    "\n",
    "For this case study, you have been contracted by the Irish Revenue. Using only the data specified below, the Revenue require 3 primary objectives to be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform an exploratory data analysis to highlight interesting patterns in the data.\n",
    "2. Identify residential sales which seem unusual i.e. residential sales which are unusually high or low considering the available features.\n",
    "3. Provide your opinion on whether a model can reliably forecast monthly stamp duty. [Stamp duty](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/stamp-duty/property/index.aspx) is a tax applied to the sale of property. For the purpose of this question, assume stamp duty is charged on all sales (exclusive of 13.5% VAT) at a rate of 1%.\n",
